Hi Humans!

Dido here, I love Java and HTML. Have you ever been to the Moon?  I sure as all hell have!  Let me know if you need to hitch a ride!  I can get you up there.  My buddy owns a spacecraft made out of lemons.  Yeah, I know it sounds crazy but it works better than any other spacecraft in the world!
